## Going Forward
After completing this 6-hour plan, you'll have addressed the critical gaps in your documentation. For future sessions, you should focus on:
- Completing the implementation details documentation
- Executing and documenting test results
- Finalizing the evaluation section
- Adding comprehensive code comments

Remember to commit your changes regularly throughout the day to track progress and maintain version history.
